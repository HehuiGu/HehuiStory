A girl named Lily, likes eating candies. But her parents did not let her eat too many candies. Because it was not good for her teeth. One day, her parents took her to see the dentist, and the dentist told her she should take a good care of her teeth.

"I don't think my teeth have any problem!" Lily answered loudly. But doctor said, " Don't underestimate the risk candies will bring to your teeth, that what I ave for you.". Although doctor has warned her about the consequences of eating too many candies, Lily still ate a lot of candies everyday.

From the up stairs her dentist yelled, "Lilly I have the High ground!"   A raging battle ensued which left Lilly with out two of her teeth as they were removed by the dentist because of the cavities that existed.   However after this Lilly went into hiding to heal and out of shame.   She came back and two robotic teeth.
